# Project Requirements: Python Code Style Analyzer

## Purpose
This project aims to create a simple tool for analyzing Python code style and providing recommendations for improvement.

## Functional Requirements

1. Code Parsing
   - Parse Python source code files (.py)
   - Handle multiple files in a directory structure

2. Style Analysis
   - Check for PEP 8 compliance
   - Identify common code smells
   - Analyze function and class complexity

3. Reporting
   - Generate a summary report of style issues
   - Provide line numbers and context for each issue
   - Offer suggestions for improvement

## Technical Requirements

1. Python Version
   - Compatible with Python 3.8 and above

2. Dependencies
   - flake8: For PEP 8 and syntax checking
   - radon: For code complexity analysis
   - black: For code formatting suggestions

3. Input/Output
   - Accept file paths or directory paths as input
   - Output results to console and optionally to a file

4. Performance
   - Analyze files under 1MB in under 5 seconds
   - Handle projects up to 100 files efficiently

## User Interface
   - Command-line interface (CLI) for easy integration into workflows

## Future Enhancements
   - Integration with popular IDEs
   - Custom rule definition for project-specific style guidelines
   - Machine learning-based suggestions for code improvement
